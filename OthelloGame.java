/**
 * Cracking the coding interview 7.8
 * Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other
 * When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom,
 * it is said to be captured and its color is flipped On your turn, you must capture at least one of
 * your opponentâ€™s pieces The game ends when either user has no more valid moves,
 * and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces Implement the object oriented design for Othello
